  <title>Fun with promises</title>
</head>

<body>
  
  <p>Take a look at <a href="./public/index.html">this code</a>. It uses promises. The purpose of the code is to wait for a set of ressources (images) to load before any other treatments. </p>
<p>
  Your job is to modify the code in order to package it into a module.
</p>
<p>
  This module will expose a function (or method) that will take as an entry a list of paths to images and the id of a div. When called, this function will load all images of the list and display them into the div.
